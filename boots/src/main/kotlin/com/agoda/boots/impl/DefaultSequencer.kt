/**
 * Default implementation of [Sequencer].
 *
 * Implementation is very simple and straightforward. It calculates list of
 * bootables in a dependency-sorted order for every [start()][Sequencer.start]
 * request as a separate task. By default it adds all non-booted [critical][Bootable.isCritical]
 * bootables in front of any other to ensure that critical bootables are booted ASAP.
 *
 * On every [next()] invocation it goes through tasks lists and for every task
 * it tries to iterate through all of it's bootables to check if any of it is
 * qualified to be invoked. Boot qualification requirements can be found at [check()][check] function.
 *
 * Also it will verify all added bootables
 * @property map container of boot tasks
 * @property tasks container of boot tasks in FIFO ordering
