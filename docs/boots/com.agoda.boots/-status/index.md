# Status

`sealed class Status`

Status is returned as a property of [Report](../-report/index.md) data class returned by the
[report()](../-boots/report.md).

### Types

| Name | Summary |
|---|---|
| [Booted](-booted/index.md) | `class Booted : `[`Status`](./index.md)<br>Booted status means that [bootable](../-bootable/index.md) has finished it's [boot()](../-bootable/boot.md) invocation without throwing any exception, thus meaning that it has booted successfully. |
| [Booting](-booting/index.md) | `class Booting : `[`Status`](./index.md)<br>Booting status means that [bootable](../-bootable/index.md) has been added to the [executor](../-executor/index.md)'s queue and will start executing/executing right now. |
| [Failed](-failed/index.md) | `class Failed : `[`Status`](./index.md)<br>Failed status means that [bootable](../-bootable/index.md) threw an exception during [boot()](../-bootable/boot.md) invocation, thus meaning that it hasn't booted successfully. |
| [Idle](-idle/index.md) | `class Idle : `[`Status`](./index.md)<br>Idle status means that [bootable](../-bootable/index.md) hasn't been touched yet by the boot system. All freshly added [bootables](../-bootable/index.md) through [add()](../-boots/add.md) get the idle status automatically. |
